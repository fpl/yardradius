Code here is contributed by Christian Gafton who worked (or works?) 
about PAM in RedHat Inc. What follows is his original README file.
I hope to contribute in the near future to this section.

README for the sample pam_radius_session module for PAM
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a sample module you can use with the pamified version of the radius
daemon. His own purpose is to fill your logs with acct packet information if
you call it with the 'debug' argument. Otherwise, it is silent.

Usage:

If you want it to be silent, but to be available to the PAM library,
configure your /etc/pam.d/radius configuration by adding the session entry
for this module:

---- /etc/pam.d/radius 	----
[... auth and account entries ...]
session		required	/lib/security/pam_radius_session
----			----

If you want it verbose:

---- /etc/pam.d/radius  ----
[... auth and account entries ...]
session         required        /lib/security/pam_radius_session debug
----                    ----


Of course, you can modify it to do you SQL database logging, etc. You are on
your own from this moment. :-)
