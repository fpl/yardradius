2004-08-19 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>

2004-08-17 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>

	* Added abinary attribute type support for Ascend binary data filter.
	  Partially based on an old Ascend patch for radius 1.16 and Cistron
	  unofficial patch. Needs surely a good and deep revision.

2004-08-02 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>

	* Changes in copyright notices of all source files.  Also some typos are now corrected.
	  License is now a new-BSD type, without the advertising clause.  
	  That is of course true only for my own code. I leaved the Lucent advertising clause 
	  in LICENSE.LUCENT as required by the old license.
	* Refinement in size definitions of all data structures.
	* A buffer overflow in calc_acctreq() has been patched.
	* Changed --version in -dumpversion for gcc versioning in configure.ac. This broke things in gcc 3. New arg is
          back compatible also.
	* Autoconf scripts converted to 2.5x series. It required deep revision of all autotools stuff. Now dist and distcheck
	  targets work smart, too. Renamed in configure.ac the main autoconfigure script.
	* All autotools configuration addons moved in an 'autotools' directory. Too many modifications into autoconf script 
	  are done to note them here. See sources, seemply rewritten many stuff. Autotools hack is art, not science.
	* configure.in changed in configure.ac.
	* acconfig.h removed due to use of the new AH_TEMPLATE macro.
	* Now builddbm and radiusd are installend under 'sbin' which seems a more correct destination for those files.
	* version.c revised to clean string manipulation.
	* GNU shtool updated to version 2.0.0.
	* Removed TODO file, introduced ROADMAP instead.
	* Removed ChangeLog file, introduced ChangeLog-1.0 and ChangeLog-1.1 instead.
	* Useful scripts are now in a 'scripts' directory to clean up top dir.
	* PGP-KEY renamed in GPG-KEY, which is more appropriate.
	* Revised README, INSTALL, BUGS and other sources documentation.
	* Fully ANSI-fied all functions around. New style of coding introduced, too: 
		
		o now function return type is kept into a standalone line. That
	  	  to list easily function in any source file by grepping.
		o all function args stay on the same line with function name.
		  Same reason.
