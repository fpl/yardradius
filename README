Yet Another Radius Daemon (YardRadius)

1. Introduction
---------------

This program is a RADIUS RFC-compliant daemon, which is derived from
original Livingston Enterprise Inc. (now Lucent Inc.) RADIUS daemon 
release 2.1. It adds a number of useful features to the LE daemon, i.e.

    Control of simultaneous logins.
    Support of Ascend, Cisco and USR boxes.
    Extended daily/monthly/yearly accouting information on a per-user basis.
    MD5 encrypted passwords support (both in passwd file and/or users file).
    Expirations in shadow file.
    Checking based on time-of-day, traffic and connection time.
    Support of PAM authentication and accounting.
    Binary form of accounting file.
    GDBM formats for users and user stats databases.
    Autoconfiguring capabilities of sources. 
    Support for Ascend binary data filters (aka abinary attributes).

It supports also all features of Lucent daemon, i.e.:

    Proxy RADIUS
    ActivCard and iPass Support (not tested by me)
    Accounting Signatures Now Required
    Vendor  Specific Attributes
    Virtual Ports
    Alternate Password File
    Address Binding
    Improved Messages
    Enhanced Debugging

All sources are much cleaner than the original versions, and
require an ANSI C compiler. A lots of potential buffer overflows have
been corrected by means of massive use of snprintf() and buffer
size checking.

YardRadius is also currently included  in Debian GNU/Linux since version
3.0 (woody).  I'm also currently  the Debian Maintainer of  that package
(and many others as well). The Debian packages are available at

http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=yardradius&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all

As far as I know, these are the only binary packages available, you generally needs
to compile it from scratch.
