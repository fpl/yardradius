This is the changelog for the 1.0 stable release.

(1.0.21) 2004-07-01 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>

    The 'middle-land' release.

      [Minor]
     
    * Editorial changes in copyright notices of all source files.
      Also some typos are now corrected.
    * New email and domain used extensively in every file.
    * Updated README to reflect new site URL and other info.
    * Refinement in size definitions of some data structures.

      [Enhancement]
      
    * Changed --version in -dumpversion for gcc versioning 
          in configure.in. This broke things in gcc 3. New arg is
          back compatible also.
    * Added entries limit to radlast. Thanks Russell Heilling 
      for patch (see feature request 464791). Changed man page
      as consequence.
    * Updated config.guess and config.sub, old releases could
      break thing on current systems.

      [Security]

    * A buffer overflow in calc_acctreq() has been patched.
    * process_menu() has been modified to check string limits.
      Thanks Max Vozeler for pointing this so old issue and
      showed a possible exploit.


(1.0.20) 2002-03-02 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@yardradiug.org>
    * Documentation has been revised and updated. Many typos are
      now corrected as well as some documentation incoherences.
      New RFCs about the RADIUS protocol suite are enclosed and
      obsolete ones removed.
    * Some files changed names for coherence.
    * getopt() returns int, not char.
    * SIGABRT is the standard definition in POSIX.1 which obsoletes
      SIGIOT. In some environment the old signal is no more defined.
    * Now changeprefix script works good on Free BSD. The non
      portable '-' argument has been skipped for sed. This caused
      problem with configure script under that platform.
    * Dictionary updated with other VSAs (Ericsson and Xedia).
    * config.sub, config.guess and other automake scripts are now 
      updated to the latest releases.
    * Major code revisions to avoid vulnerabilities due to strcpy()
      memcpy() and other dangerous functions. 
      - Digest Calculation Buffer Overflow Vulnerability.
      - Invalid attribute length calculation on malformed VSA.
      Non full-disclosures are available at CERT.org
    * Added my GPG key to code.

      Some of those changes are stolen from a VA Linux patch for
      Lucent Radius 2.1.

(1.0.19) 2001-08-27 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Added a first version of man files under `man' directory.
      Some old draft documentation files have been removed,
      as consequence.
    * Default prefix is changed in `/usr/local/yardradius'
    * A couple of commas in configure.in which caused a ',6' 
      file when --enable-debian was used has been deleted. 
      A minor, but truly amazing bug :)
    * Many typos and grammar errors in doc corrected (or hoping so).
    * Configure.in did not install logs and doc directory when
      prefix is not set on command line. Now also this is ok.

(1.0.18) 2001-08-21 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Patched for a subdle bug due to __debug definition in extens.c.
    * Skipped auth_item check when Auth-Type=PAM.
    * Skipping void reply items in parsing GDBM users files.

      All patches are due to William K. Volkman.

(1.0.17) 2001-08-18 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com> 
    * Configuration file modified to add a --enable-debian option.
      It greatly simplifies support of Debian packaging. Debian
      package is released as a separate package in Debian 'unstable'
      distribution.
    * Now builddbm and radiusd are installend under sbin which
      seems a more correct destination for those files.

(1.0.16/pre16) 2001-01-14 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com> 
    * Dictionary entries for BayNetworks/Nortel Annex is added.
    * Now, YARD RADIUS is compatible with GDBM 1.7.3, which seems the 
      most commonly installed version. Just changed the gdbm_open()
      function arguments for this.
    * Since now, the official name of the package is
      Yard Radius. This to avoid confusion with other packages
      with the same name, and to be coherent with a next-to-come 
      Debian package (yeah!).
      I changed also version numbering. The current version is 
      1.0.16, i.e. 1.0 patch level 16. It seems more `standard',
      and to be honest I really think this program is too much
      robust to leave it in pre-release status... Am I an optimist?
    * Changed including of time.h and sys/time.h as suggested in autoconf
      manuals. This allows installation under AIX and other systems
      which could need both files. Incidentally, under AIX it compiles
      also with the off-the-shelf C compiler.
    * PAM configuring in configure.in is changed to avoid a 
      subdle configuration bug: some linux distributions do not
      install PAM development libraries, so that PAM support cannot
      be enabled on them, while building. This includes Debian 2.2
      and RedHat.  That's not a problem on Solaris or FreeBSD 
      which install them as default. This require a modification
      of configure.in which is now smarter. 
    * An silly ortographic error in configure.in with --enable-pam
      has been corrected.
    * Builddbm now works under the conf directory, not the current one.
    * License and Readme files have been changed. There is no more
      an ANNOUNCE file and COPYING (which is the standard name for
      GPL) is now named LICENSE (which is the standard name for BSD).
    * A CONFIGURATION text file has been added to summarize main
      configuration issues. Are you happy?
    * Many other (little) adjustments.
    
(pre15) 2000-09-26 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Installer now create also logs directory and explains
      the structure.
    * Deleted Log entries from sources to avoid redundant comments
      with CVS.

(pre14) 2000-09-21 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Corrected autoconf/automake 
      configuration to solve some problems of installation
      under a few architectures. Configure now use Gnu Shell Tool
      instead of the default BSD-like installation. Moreover,
      several new tests have been added/modified for PAM and 
      linker.
    * Changed some configuration args.
    * snprintf() is now used extensively to be maniacally sure
      that no buffer overflow is possible.
    * Also sources now compile on Linux 2.2, FreeBSD 4.0 
      Solaris 2.5.1+ and DEC Unix 4.0+ (formerly Compaq Tru64 Unix)
      as I personally tested.
    * Sources are cleaner, now you should not have any 
      warning with cc under Compaq Tru64 (formerly DEC Unix).
    * Dictionary has been revised and updated. Now it includes
      Redback and SpringTide entries.

(pre13) 1999-09-28 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    
    * Default mode now does not spawn as before, so -s argument has
      the opposite meaning. This is because it's more correct to
      manage GDBM files.
    * More modification to radlist program. Its format strings now
      include alignement values.

(pre11) 1999-09-24 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Modified radlist for extended flexible output and 
      corrected minor bugs. Needs yet an eye for extended port
      information.
    * gdbm_open() call corrected in builddbm (wrong number of args)
    * changed size argument of gdbm_open() calls everywhere
    * some little modification in #defines and other.

(pre10) 1999-09-22 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Modified radlast for extended flexible output and
      corrected minor bugs. Radlist needs yet an eye...
    * Revised some minor details in other files.
    * Modified acct.c to manage correctly Ascend NUL terminated strings

(pre9) 1999-09-21 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Minor error in #ifdef among sources corrected
    * Automake file rewritten for a clean ditribution. 
    * Autoconfiguring improved for linker flags
    * Minor bugs in configuration files corrected
    * Added a portable version of snprintf()/vsnprintf()
      and modified configure.in to support them on demand

1999-09-20 Francesco P. Lovergine <francesco@lovergine.com>
    * Integrates autoconf & automake
    * Changed a bit formats of radlast/radlist
    * Now radwatch and radtest compile
