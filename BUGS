Bugs notes for YardRadius
=========================

Known BUGS
----------

- The user-stats structure seems not able to store modem speeds for some
  NASes. Those data are anyway available in the `detail' files.
  The problem is that not all NASes use the same attributes to report them
  and the format is not standardized.

- Occasionally the user stats database maintains (incorrectly) yet logged
  users who are no more actually on the NAS. This happens randomly. My
  guess is that for some reason no acct logout packet reach the daemon,
  within the time-out/retry period of the NAS, due to high traffic,
  cpu load or occasional LAN failures. 
  If possible, please enlarge that period on the NAS and ensure to check
  your LAN settings and hardware. This problem could be particularly 
  annoying if you limit logins on a per-user basis :( 

Known NON-BUGS
--------------

Please consult accurately the old Livingston's guide. 
Often, what seems a bug is only a configuration misunderstanding.
